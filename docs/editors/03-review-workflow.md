# Review Workflow

Learn how to collaborate with your team using the review system.

## Understanding Review Modes

Adonis EOS has a three-tier review system to ensure content quality:

1. **Approved** (Live Content) - Currently published content
2. **AI Review** - AI-generated suggestions (admin only)
3. **Review** - Human review before publishing

## For Editors

### Creating Content for Review

1. Open a post in the editor
2. Make your changes in the main editing area
3. Click **"Save for Review"** instead of "Save Changes"
4. Your changes are saved to the Review draft (not live)
5. An Editor Admin will be notified to review your work

### Viewing Your Review Status

Look at the tabs at the top of the editor:
- **Approved**: Currently live content
- **Review**: Your pending changes (if any)

Switch between tabs to compare what's live vs. what you've submitted for review.

### After Approval

Once an Editor Admin approves your review:
- Your changes go live automatically
- The Review draft is cleared
- You can start working on new changes

## For Editor Admins

### Reviewing Content

1. Open a post that has pending reviews
2. Click the **"Review"** tab to see proposed changes
3. Review the content carefully
4. You can make additional edits if needed
5. Click **"Approve Review"** to publish the changes

### AI Review (Advanced)

If AI agents are configured, you may see an **"AI Review"** tab:
- This contains AI-generated suggestions
- Review the AI changes carefully
- Click **"Approve AI Review"** to move them to the Review tab
- Make manual adjustments in Review mode
- Finally approve to publish

## Best Practices

### For Editors:
- **Save frequently**: Save drafts as you work
- **Use descriptive titles**: Help reviewers understand your changes
- **Add comments**: If your CMS has a comments feature, explain significant changes
- **Check before submitting**: Review your own work before sending for approval

### For Editor Admins:
- **Review promptly**: Keep the content pipeline moving
- **Provide feedback**: Help editors improve
- **Check SEO fields**: Ensure meta titles and descriptions are optimized
- **Test links**: Verify all URLs and CTAs work correctly

## Revision History

Every save creates a revision:
- View past versions in the "Revisions" panel
- See who made changes and when
- Revert to a previous version if needed
- Revisions are kept for a configurable retention period

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I edit published content?**
A: Yes! Edit the Approved version and click "Save Changes" to update live content immediately (Editor Admins only). Or save for review to have changes approved first.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally save changes?**
A: Use the Revisions panel to revert to a previous version.

**Q: Can I have multiple people review the same post?**
A: Yes, but only one Review draft exists at a time. Coordinate with your team to avoid overwriting each other's work.

**Q: How do I know if a post needs review?**
A: The dashboard shows review status for each post. Look for the "Review" badge.
